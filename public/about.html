<h1>About us</h1>
<p>What is a Website? A collection of web pages and media over the internet is called a website. The website can be published on at least one web server and can be identified by a common domain name, for example - javatpoint.com, google.com, youtube.com.</p>
<p>All the websites that are accessible publicly come under the World Wide Web. There is a website that is accessed only on a private network. Most of the websites are dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, for example, education, news, commerce, entertainment, or Social networking. The websites start with a home page, which is followed by some navigation page that is linked by the Hyperlinking between the web pages.</p>
<p>History of Website -One of the British CERN physicist named Tim Berners-Lee created the WWW (World Wide Web) in 1990. It was free from 30 April 1993 by CERN. The gopher protocol and the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) were used before the introduction of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). They only offer a simple directory structure, and the documents will be presented as a plain text file without any formatting.</p>
